## Dynamic image
Easily create images that change based on input data.


## Why?
There are many places on the web where you can add images but no dynamic content. For example this Github Repo README or a marketing email. So the more exicting we can make images the more engaging these sort of online spaces will be. 

Images on the web are usually static. That means that every time you request that image you see the exact sampe result. Dynamic images are regenerated everytime they are request from the server. This allows the content of those images to change. A simple example would be updating some text in an image based on time of the day.

### Static image example
First request...
Second request...

### Dynamic image example
First request...
Second request...

## Live example
This image below is an example of a dynamic image. Whenever it is requested the server gets my latest follower via the Github Graphql API and dynamically generates the image using the latest followers username and profile image. Finally the image is returned to the browser. If you were to follow me and then refresh this page you will see the image change.
